    <p><strong><i>Stojanović Mokranjac</i></strong> <em><b>(January 9, 1856–1914)</b></em> was a <b>Serbian</b> composer and music educator. His work was essential in bringing the spirit of Valach Serbian unwritten folk poems into organized art.</p>
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>He was born in <b>Negotin.</b> From the birthplace of his parents he drew the second last name <b>Mokranjac</b> (literally: resident of Mokranje).</p>
    <p>He graduated from the <b>Belgrade</b> high school, and attended the natural science and mathematics section of the <b>University of Belgrade.</b> In 1879 he traveled to <b>Munich</b> where he studied music in the class of <i>Josef Rheinberger.</i> After a brief break, he continued to study in <b>Rome</b> in the class of <i>Parisotti</i>, in 1884. Returning to <b>Serbia</b> in 1884 he briefly became the conductor of the <b>Kornelije Stanković choir of Belgrade.</b></p>
    <p><i>From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in Leipzig,</i> <b>Germany.</b> Upon his return to <b>Serbia</b> in 1887 he became the conductor of the <b>Belgrade singing society (Belgrade Choir).</b> From 1887 to 1900 he taught music at the <b>Belgrade</b> high school, and in 1901 transferred to Bogoslovija <b>(Belgrade Theological College)</b> where he taught church singing. Together with <b>Stanislav Binički and Cvetko Manojlović, Mokranjac</b> founded the first independent music school in 1899 - <b>Serbian Music School in Belgrade.</b> He remains the director of this school until his death. Today the school bears his name. His work as a melograph bore many transcriptions of thus far unwritten folk songs.</p>
    <p><b>Mokranjac died in Skopje, Macedonia (then Kingdom of Serbia), aged 58.</b></p>

    <h2>Works</h2>
    <p> His life was highly influenced by church and folk songs, and he used these two types of music as inspiration for his work. His most famous pieces are the fifteen <b>Rukoveti (Potpourri; literally: "handfuls" or "bunches")</b> - a collection of songs and music (orchestral suites) based on motives of Serbian folk music from <b>Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia Proper, Montenegro, Kosovo and Metohija, Macedonia and Bulgaria.</b> His other prominent folk-based works include <b>Primorski napjevi (Coastland tunes), and Kozar.</b></p>
    <p>A significant number of his works were made for church services. Such as the <b><em>Božanstvena Liturgija Svetog Jovana Zlatoustog (The Divine Liturgy of St. Chrysostom),</em></b> from which the <b><em>Heruvimska pesma (Cherubic hymn)</em></b> is most famous.
